Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`Goerli network`.

The smart contracts are already deployed to the goerli network and the address are located in the contract-addresses file in the contracts subfolder of the frontend.
The smart contract supports deposits in both usdc as well as eth.
The frontend has only been coded to support eth deposits.
